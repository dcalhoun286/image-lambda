## Feature Tasks

- A user should be able to upload an image at any size, and have both the original size and a thumbnail size
- When an image is uploaded to your S3 bucket, it should trigger a Lambda function which must:
  - Create a 50x50 pixel thumbnail version of that image
  - Save it to another S3 bucket
  - It should do so with a predictable naming convention, so that your server and/or frontend know where that thumbnail image will be
